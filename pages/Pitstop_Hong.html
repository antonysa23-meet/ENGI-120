    <!-- Introduction Section -->
    <section class="section-card" id="intro" data-aos="fade-up">
        <p>
            In my team, we have a total of 4 team members. This includes me, Luke Van Leeuwen, Antony Saleh, and Connor Gumbs. Each of us is from a different residential college and major. I am from Sid Richardson, majoring in Mechanical Engineering; Luke is from Duncan, majoring in Mechanical Engineering, Antony is from McMurtry, majoring in Electrical Engineering, and Connor is from Jones, majoring in Computer Science. Personally, my overall hope for this rover wheel project is to have a successful final design and finish all the paperwork, such as design reports, efficiently and with high quality. Regarding the whole team, I hope we can maintain a good relationship with each other, and we can always be excited to work together and put our passion into the design. In the Team Pits Stop, we discussed with each other and performed a thorough analysis of the team performance based on our progress on the rover wheel project, and we found some strengths that helped us to be successful in our design process. However, some weaknesses hinder our achievements.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-3">
            First, we have three main advantages in our team: Good organization of work, decent delegation of tasks, and effective communication between the team members and also our writing mentors, faculty mentor, and TA. To be specific, we have an equal distribution of the amount of work, and each of us are very responsible toward our own task. Usually, the tasks are finished before the deadline, and we have enough time to discuss, review, and improve them. This helps us in forming the work with innovative ideas.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-3">
            Nevertheless, we still have some weaknesses. First, even though we set a scheduled time for a team meeting, team members are still late for the meeting. Sometimes, team members were even missing from the meeting because they were not informed about the schedule. Second, we were not great at updating the progress with each other, leading to the situation that we have to wait for each other to continue on the work, and this wastes a lot of time. Last, we were always focused on the work, meaning that we are still not very familiar with each other. This holds back from our close cooperation. To improve the current situation and try our best to minimize our weaknesses, we need to make a SMART plan and comply to it strictly.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-3">
            Personally, I also have some weaknesses. First, I suffered from procrastination as usually the time I have left after finishing the work is not enough for a complete review. Second, for most of the time I was just working with my own assigned task in the group instead of actively contributing to the group project. To improve the situation, I need to make two SMART goals to address these weaknesses. For the first issue, I need to make my own time schedule, assigning a specific time for doing the tasks for the project. This will force myself to finish the work ahead of the deadline. For the second issue I have, I will have to contribute more actively to the group.
