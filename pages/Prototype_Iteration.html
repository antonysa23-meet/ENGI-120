        <h2>Prototyping Overview</h2>
        <p>
            Throughout our prototyping process, we developed six key iterations of our rover wheel design. From the start, we identified three essential features that would define a successful wheel: an effective axle attachment structure, a non-pneumatic tire design, and surface modifications (spikes or treads) to enhance traction on challenging terrain.
        </p>
        <p>
            Each iteration built upon lessons learned from the previous version, allowing us to refine our approach through systematic testing and evaluation. This methodical process helped us identify the optimal combination of materials, manufacturing techniques, and design features to meet the client's requirements.

    <section class="section-card" id="iteration-1-2" data-aos="fade-up">
        <h2>Iteration 1 & 2: PLA Low Fidelity Prototypes</h2>

        <h3 class="h5 text-primary mt-4 mb-3">Design Approach</h3>
        <p>
            Our first two iterations were low-fidelity prototypes designed to serve as both proof-of-concept models and visual representations of our ideas. We created two wheels with identical core structures and dimensions, but tested different exterior designs—one with treads and one with spikes. Since the CAD models only required minor modifications between the two designs, we pursued both options simultaneously.
        </p>

        </div>

        <h3 class="h5 text-primary mt-4 mb-3">Implementation</h3>
        <p>
            These 3D-printed models incorporated all the key features we had identified. The central axle attachment was designed to match the motor specifications Rice Robotics planned to use in their rover. The spikes and treads were sized according to our initial design specifications. The main purpose of these prototypes was to translate our concept into a physical form and compare our design against the existing low-fidelity wheels that Rice Robotics had made for their rover prototype.

        </div>

        <h3 class="h5 text-primary mt-4 mb-3">Findings and Next Steps</h3>
        <p>
            Testing revealed several important limitations. PLA did not provide adequate traction or compression for the rover's needs. Additionally, we observed that the spikes were not securely attached and could easily break off or become damaged under stress. Based on these findings, we decided to transition to TPU for our next iteration, a material known for its superior grip and flexibility compared to rigid PLA.

        <h2>Iteration 3: TPU Medium Fidelity Prototype</h2>

        <h3 class="h5 text-primary mt-4 mb-3">Design Strategy</h3>
        <p>
            For our third iteration, we explored a hybrid approach: combining a TPU exterior with a PLA core structure. We modified our earlier CAD models by removing the center components and printing only the outer wheel sections. This strategy aimed to combine TPU's traction benefits with PLA's structural support.

        </div>

        <h3 class="h5 text-primary mt-4 mb-3">Manufacturing Challenges</h3>
        <p>
            The printing process proved more difficult than expected. We struggled to achieve consistent quality, facing challenges with extrusion speed, extruder temperature, and overall print time. Even a single low-quality wheel required significant time investment, making this approach impractical for producing four wheels within our timeline. These manufacturing difficulties, combined with insights from our first two iterations, led us to pivot our strategy. We decided to purchase pre-existing wheels and modify them to achieve our desired performance characteristics.

    <section class="section-card" id="iteration-4" data-aos="fade-up">
        <h2>Iteration 4: Medium-High Fidelity Prototype</h2>

        <h3 class="h5 text-primary mt-4 mb-3">Modified Commercial Base</h3>
        <p>
            In this iteration, we purchased a commercial non-pneumatic wheel that met our size requirements. This wheel served as a testbed for our manufacturing methods and allowed us to conduct our first full-scale durability and traction tests, as it matched our target dimensions and came in slightly above our weight goal. We modified the wheel by drilling holes in the exterior and securing rugby cleat spikes with adhesive. We also attempted to carve treads into the rubber surface, but the wheel's hardness made this impractical. A makeshift axle was fabricated and attached to test the mounting system's ease of use.
        </p>

        <h3 class="h5 text-primary mt-4 mb-3">Testing and Insights</h3>
        <p>
            We experimented with different spike layouts to determine which configuration would provide the best traction. This iteration yielded valuable information: using a purchased wheel as a base for modifications was the most viable path forward, and spikes were more effective than treads for our application. However, we identified two critical issues. First, the spikes had a tendency to detach, indicating we needed a more robust attachment method. Second, feedback from Dr. Holmes and Dr. McGlamery revealed that the rugby cleat spikes were too large, reducing ground contact area and limiting traction performance. These findings guided our next steps: we purchased additional base wheels and switched to smaller track spikes with optimized placement patterns.

        <h3 class="h5 text-primary mt-4 mb-3">Refined Design Implementation</h3>
        <p>
            For iterations five and six, we used the same commercial wheel base as iteration 4, but replaced the rugby cleat spikes with smaller track spikes and tested different spike layouts. We carefully measured and marked the placement of each spike, then used precision drilling and adhesive to ensure strong, secure attachments. Fresh wheels were used for these iterations to avoid any performance degradation from the tread-cutting experiments in iteration 4.

        <h3 class="h5 text-primary mt-4 mb-3">Performance Comparison</h3>
        <p>
            Testing showed that both iterations performed similarly in terms of traction, meeting our performance targets. However, iteration 6 demonstrated superior durability and replicability, making it the clear choice for our final design recommendation.

    <!-- Final Prototype Selection -->
    <section class="section-card" id="final-selection" data-aos="fade-up">
        <h2>Final Prototype Selection</h2>
        <p>
            Based on our systematic testing and evaluation, we selected iteration 6 as our final prototype. This design successfully integrates all three key features we identified at the project's outset: a robust axle attachment structure, non-pneumatic tire construction, and enhanced traction through strategically placed spikes.
        </p>
        <p>
            The final prototype met or exceeded all client requirements and performed best across most of our evaluation criteria. We sourced high-quality components and took care to precisely position and secure each spike. Most importantly, the wheel exceeded our target performance in traction—our highest priority design criterion. This success was made possible through our methodical iterative process, where each version informed the next, leading us to an optimized solution that balances performance, manufacturability, and cost.
