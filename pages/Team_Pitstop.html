            Rover Wheels, the engineering design team I am a part of, consists of members Luke Van Leeuwen, Connor Gumbs, Hong Guo, and Antony Saleh, majoring in Mechanical Engineering, Mathematical Economic Analysis, Mechanical Engineering, and Electrical Engineering, respectively. We come from a multitude of colleges, including McMurtry, Duncan, Jones, and Sid Richardson. Our team has a very robust working structure, where we have a highly monochronic workflow that focuses on high individualism. We have always agreed that high directness in constructive criticism is something we all value, and thus, our pitstop was fully direct in communications.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-3">
            Though the idea of a team pitstop can seem frightening at first, it is crucial to the development and flow of a team. Thus, our team made sure to approach the pitstop with an open-minded yet direct approach. The climate was very light, with everybody being open to constructive criticism; some team members even admitted their own faults without being prompted about them and accepted further feedback. During the pitstop, we started by giving some kudos to our effort and consistent attempts at improvement. We then discussed how we felt about our progress. What hindered it? What has been helping it? How can we further expedite it? We also discussed our team's aspirations and how we would like to continue with this project. Additionally, we commented on our strengths and weaknesses as a team.

    <!-- Reflection Section -->

        <p>
            Under the above plan, I will ensure that I improve my communication skills with the team. I will ensure that I communicate any change in my schedule that would cause an inability to attend a meeting. This will help build trust and open communication within the team. I believe there should be hefty repercussions for not being able to stick to the SMART plan, as it is very crucial that everyone is present and active in the team; these could include an effect on my overall grade in the course. Furthermore, I believe that being able to handle stress allows me to properly prosper and show my potential for the team, and thus, if I stick to the SMART plan, I will be able to better support the team with efficiency and completion of our work on time.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-3">
            As for the team, keeping up efficient communication by using the SMART plan described above is very important to prevent the team from wasting time waiting on a task someone is already doing, without realizing its completion. This will be further strengthened by the new method for agreeing on meeting times, described above. Furthermore, as a result of building team ethos, there will be more inclusivity and comfort in the team, allowing each member to share their opinion, give their input, and thus provide a higher quality of idea creation.
