# About Me Reflection Questionnaire

Please answer the following questions to help generate your "About Me" page. Be as specific as possible!

## 1. Working in Teams
*   **Collaboration:** How did you specifically work with your teammates during the prototyping phase? (e.g., "I paired with [Name] to build the rim," "We held daily stand-ups to track progress.")
    *   *Answer: Well , I researched different materials that we could buy with the help of luke, additionally me connor and hong all work d together on building and structuring the wheels,  implementing spikes to them and trying different permutations of spikes* 
*   **Your Role:** What was your specific primary responsibility? (e.g., "I was the CAD lead," "I managed the testing procedures," "I fabricated the grousers.")
    *   *Answer: I mainly did research into different materials and had a heavy supporting role in designing the prototypes* 
*   **Handling Challenges:** Describe a specific conflict or technical hurdle the team faced and how *you* helped resolve it. (e.g., "We disagreed on the material for the spokes, so I set up a decision matrix," or "The prototype broke during testing, so I led the brainstorming for the fix.")
    *   *Answer: We doisagreed on whether to try to go further into moulding or onot, I helped resolve it by asking for outside opinion such as the people working at the OEDK and our mentors, and together we deemed it unrealistic to carry out rubber moulding* 

## 2. Engineering Design Skills
*   **Application:** How did you apply the Engineering Design Process (EDP) specifically during prototyping? (e.g., "I used the iterative method to refine the spoke thickness after the first print failed.")
    *   *Answer: WE used theiterative provess to dictate which steps to take in our design process, where to try and further explore, and where to stay away fromn, this is how we got to our finalised pattern of spieks* 
*   **Improvement:** In what specific area did you see yourself improve the most? (e.g., "I got much better at designing for manufacturability," "My ability to analyze failure modes improved.")
    *   *Answer: I gained a lot of knowledge on real world testing, and identifying how different tests mnight be used to test the reliability of a product* 

## 3. Technical Skills
*   **Hard Skills:** List the specific technical skills you utilized. (e.g., SolidWorks/Fusion360, 3D Printing (PLA/PETG/Resin), Laser Cutting, Lathe/Mill work, soldering, Python for data analysis.)
    *   *Answer: I learnt how to do PLA 3D printing, additionally, how to usye basic handl= tools as I had no experience prior to this, and finally minimla level of CAD using fusion* 
*   **Methodologies:** Did you use any specific testing or selection methods? (e.g., FEA analysis, tensile testing, Pugh Screening.)
    *   *Answer: Pugh testing, and a specific test for traction called the Vehicle and physical traction test*
