1. Clarifying the Team Assignment

Before designing anything, it was essential for our team to establish a clear and shared understanding of the task assigned by our client. Our project centers on supporting the Rice Robotics Club, which is preparing a rover for the University Rover Challenge (URC)—a Mars-inspired competition requiring high-performance, non-pneumatic wheels capable of navigating extreme terrain.

Through discussions with the Robotics Club, reviewing the URC rulebook, and examining the rover’s mechanical constraints, we clarified several critical elements of our assignment:

We must design six non-pressurized rover wheels for a 50-kg rover using a rocker-bogie suspension.

Wheels must perform well on soft sand, gravel, boulders, steep slopes, and step-downs.

The design must be low-cost, manufacturable, and reliable under extreme desert conditions.

Wheel-to-leg mounting is evolving, so our design must remain flexible and adjustable.

We are allowed and encouraged to explore unconventional or hybrid wheel concepts, not just standard rover wheels.

The final wheels may be featured in the System Acceptance Review video and will be used during qualification.

Clarifying this assignment prevented our team from designing wheels that “look good” but fail to address real competition constraints. It also ensured alignment between our team, the client, and the end users.

2. Understanding the Problem & Context

A strong engineering solution begins with a deep understanding of the problem space. Our team researched four major areas: the client’s needs, the rover environment, relevant engineering principles, and lessons from past URC teams.

Understanding the Client

The Rice Robotics Club’s biggest challenges with their current temporary wheels include:

Poor traction on loose terrain

Insufficient durability during testing

Excessive slippage and digging-in

Unreliable mounting and detachment issues

Material limitations (weak polymer wheels, thin treads)

The club emphasized that traction, durability, and reliability are their highest priorities.

Understanding the Environment

URC terrain is intentionally designed to resemble Mars:

Soft, unconsolidated sand → wheels can sink or slip

Loose gravel → reduces grip

Rock fields & boulders → require impact resistance

Steep slopes up to ~30° → require high torque and traction

Desert heat and dust → cause material fatigue and wear

We learned from URC reports that many teams fail due to:

Wheels detaching mid-mission

Wheels cracking from brittle materials

Poor traction preventing movement

Overweight wheels consuming mass budget

This reinforced the importance of designing wheels that balance traction, material strength, and manufacturability.

Understanding Engineering Principles

Our research focused on:

Terramechanics (wheel-terrain interaction)

Wheel slip ratios and traction forces

Rigid vs. flexible wheel materials

Benefits of large wheel radius (better obstacle clearance but heavier)

Use of grousers to increase grip on loose soil

Hybrid rubber-metal tread systems used by top teams

Successful teams commonly combine:

Metal frames for strength

Rubber or polymer treads for traction

Modular components for maintenance

This informed our direction toward a hybrid wheel concept.

Understanding Past Designs

We analyzed wheels from:

NASA’s Curiosity & Perseverance rovers

Missouri S&T’s Talos team

BYU Mars Rover

Cal Poly FDR teams

Several top-10 URC teams

Trends included:

Wide wheels for flotation

Alternating-height grousers

Metal spokes with rubberized outer layers

Larger-radius wheels for improved clearance

Avoiding PLA due to brittleness

This competitive research helped us determine which design patterns to adopt or avoid.

3. Defining the Design Criteria

The final step of the Design Analysis Stage is converting everything we learned into quantitative, measurable design criteria.

Our criteria include required constraints (such as URC rules) as well as ranked performance goals based on our client interviews and background research.

Our Design Criteria

(Ranked from most to least important)

Traction — must provide ≥ 62 N of force per wheel

Durability — must withstand ≥ 75 kg load

Replicability — modular design, target UDS score 4.5–5

Replaceability — < 1 minute per wheel during field swaps

Weight — optimized to preserve rover mass budget

Size — flexible based on evolving leg design

Coolness / Aesthetics — UDS target ~3.5

Regulations — must meet all URC rulebook constraints

These criteria were refined through a Pairwise Comparison Chart and formalized in a Design Criteria Table.

We designed two User-Defined Scales (UDS):

Coolness — 1 to 5 (visual appeal, recognizability)

Replicability — 1 to 5 (ease of assembly, modular structure)

By quantifying every factor, we ensured our future solution evaluation would remain objective and engineering-driven.

Conclusion of the Design Analysis Stage

The Design Analysis Stage established a strong foundation for our project by clearly understanding:

The client's needs and constraints

The mission environment

The engineering principles relevant to rover mobility

Lessons learned from successful (and unsuccessful) past designs

The measurable design criteria guiding our decisions

This stage confirmed four key insights:

Wheel functionality and consistency are the client's highest priorities.

Every design decision involves trade-offs—traction vs. weight, durability vs. cost, size vs. manufacturability.

Meeting our User-Defined Scales for replicability and aesthetic appeal is important but secondary to performance.

Effective prototyping and testing will be essential to validate our assumptions.

With a thoroughly researched and clearly defined problem space, our team is now prepared to move into the Solution Stage, where we will brainstorm design concepts, develop prototypes, evaluate them against our criteria, and iterate toward a final wheel design for the URC competition.
